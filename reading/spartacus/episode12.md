Crixus honors the memory of your husband.
As do we all.
We should put these dark times behind us And with Solonius' blood Amend our grief.
Crixus! Crixus! I request words with Batiatus, Yet you return absent the man.
Other matters occupy his attention.
I've pressed for audience all week.
Dominus forgets who his champion is.
It is you who forgets title, master and slave.
Apologies.
I have made many mistakes since becoming champion.
Know that i intend to rectify them shortly.
Good citizens of Capua! I stand before you, The sting of tears yet hot upon my cheek, To redress a most vile crime Against our city and our hearts.
The murder of Magistrate Titus Calavius! His life stolen for lust of profit and advancement.
His warmth and guidance Torn from our hands And those of loving wife and noble son! Yet today we shall witness justice! The base criminal that has so wounded us shall be executed Ad Gladium! (Ad Gladium = death by sword) Enter Solonius! Enemy of the people! Fucking pig! Traitor! Slice his traitor tongue off! You fucking pig! And who shall balance the scales? Who shall restore honor to our city? Spartacus! There is but one man! The slayer of Theokoles! The bringer of rain! Spartacus! Champion of Capua! You survived your execution, Thracian.
Upon these very sands.
Perhaps good Solonius will fare as well.
I would not expect it.
Begin! Fight me, damn it! Why does Spartacus not strike in return? He but extends the moment, to the favor of the crowd.
The villain's blood will flow soon enough.
Your husband has been a gift from the gods.
Numerius would be lost without his support.
He gains great comfort in the act.
The comfort is ours.
He will make a fine father, when the day comes.
Look, Spartacus draws blood.
You are not absent skill.
Nor desire to live.
You see? Solonius comes to his end.
And who would not wish it? The streets of rome are wet with tears of your loss.
We have not received word from you, Ilithyia.
Did you speak to your husband? About patronage for the house of Batiatus? At length.
He comes to Capua a day hence, To discuss the matter personally.
The roar of the crowd.
There is no sound more glorious.
The last you shall hear.
You take the wrong life.
Your master Batiatus, is the villain.
And shall join you presently.
Kill! Spartacus! I would not have Agron risk himself on behalf of brotherly bond.
See him separated from duro in future games.
And, what of Spartacus? He grows restless at not receiving audience.
The proceedings with Solonius have filled my attentions.
Send mira to occupy his thoughts.
I will summon him in the morning.
Dominus.
Robes, fit for a man of breeding and intelligence! You wear them well.
Today day beheld the end of Solonius.
A welcomed spectacle, given purchase By your loyalty and cunning.
You shall be removed from the ludus immediately.
Removed? You'll reside in the villa.
Elevated far above the common men, Your devious fucking mind close to elbow.
Gratitude seizes the tongue.
Well perhaps a woman will aid in the untangling of it.
Name any slave, and the wet joys of her body are yours.
I confess to certain longings.
For one not yet soiled by the other men.
Give name to your desire, and see it fulfilled.
Apologies.
My presence was commanded.
By Batiatus? His words set me to purpose.
But they were gladly received I tend your wound.
Stand guard at your request while you stain hands with blood.
And you discard a simple touch? My mind is taken with other thoughts.
Then break open head and share them.
I fear Batiatus suspects my hand in aulus' death.
He appears absent the weight of pressing concern.
Then why does he not grant me audience? What secrets did aulus reveal in dying breath, That so inflamed? That his hand robbed sura of life.
By command of Batiatus.
You plan vengeance! You cannot do this! Spartacus that is not what she called me! Never again will i hear her whisper my true name.
Or taste the joy of it on her lips.
I will see the light fade from his eyes, Or join her in the attempt.
At expense of my life? The Thracian does not know roman law! If one slave spills the blood of his master All are put to death.
Each to his own fate.
And i to mine.
You move with strong purpose Spurred, by your victory.
When i defeated pericles, And you were not in the Pulvinus There is no meaning to glory, without your eyes to witness.
They will never again be absent.
Naevia? Hurry! Quickly! Naevia! Domina.
What business do you attend, that you do not answer? Fetching wine, Domina.
Apologies, i did not hear.
.
Leave it.
There is a service required of you by Dominus.
>My heart quickens at such a vision.
Please Set mind to ease.
I cling to no grudge for past transgressions.
I do not understand.
You spoke with Doctore, after it was said Barca secured his freedom.
I told him nothing.
A thing of no consequence.
Turn it from your thoughts.
As i have turned it from mine In favor of more Intimate concerns I have admired your beauty for many years.
Were you aware of my affections? I have felt your gaze linger of late.
A gaze is all i could dare.
Your position placing you forever beyond my grasp.
Delicate, ripe Naevia.
Always the forbidden fruit.
Until now You tremble.
Has a man never kissed you Caressed the soft curves of your hips Slipped inside of you Domina has seen me remain untouched.
Then we are both In her debt.
You give her away as if a common whore! I've preserved her chastity since she was a child, Towards presenting it as gift! The only gift of chastity is in its removal.
By a man of worth! Not fucking Ashur! Naevia has been my most trusted slave.
The thought of that fucking Syrian shoving his devious cock inside her It's a betrayal, Quintus.
It is a necessity.
Set details of it aside, and shift mind To Glaber's arrival.
His patronage brings to climax All our labors.
When the sun rises on the house of Batiatus Everything will change.
Your wooden man gives almost as much fight as Solonius.
With each victory, I draw closer to facing you again in the arena.
And reclaiming stolen glories.
There is no glory.
Only blood.
Spilled for the pleasure of the romans.
And how they shall roar, when i spill your blood upon the sands.
Spartacus! You are summoned.
I fear you will never have the chance.
Watch what you're fucking doing! Fuck.
Be careful with that! Dominus.
Where are the flowers? Go find the new girl and bring fucking flowers! A house full of slaves, have to do fucking everything myself.
The champion of Capua graces us with his presence! Apologies for not receiving you sooner.
I have been consumed with the tumult of recent events.
Much has changed.
The world reforms at our feet, The very earth thrusting us to unimaginable heights! At great cost.
Easily paid! At this very moment Legatus Glaber thunders towards us to bestow patronage.
I know your feelings towards the man.
I would ask that they be put aside, in favor of more noble pursuits.
Glaber took Sura from my arms.
But he is not the man that took her life.
Aurelia? Would that be all? Yep, fine, leave.
What is she doing here? Working beneath my employ, to pay off varro's debts.
I pledged my winnings to such a cause.
You did not tell her this? Of course.
She would have no coin from your purse, nor mine, unless it was obtained by means of fair labor.
she wishes to serve the house of Batiatus, until all his debts are balanced.
She is a good woman.
and worthy of consideration.
And she shall receive it in abundance.
Now tell me, what matter were ywu so eager To discuss with me? I merely sought word towards Varro's wife, and that she had been provided for.
Excellent! So all is well between us.
I require words with Spartacus.
Why the fuck would i allow that? Because my tongue remains silent towards the gate key you lost.
You would have it remain so? Be quick.
Opportunity presents itself, yet Batiatus lives.
For the moment.
Last night the lives of every slave Under this roof meant nothing to you.
Then Aurelia appears, and you grow a conscience! Varro was as a brother.
I will not see his wife put at risk.
You put the woman at risk when you killed her husband.
Crixus! A parting gift.
What is this shit? A memento of your battle with theokoles.
The city was filled with such novelties after Spartacus brought the rains.
The craftsmanship was rather poor.
Dominus finally decides to remove you from the company of men? Far removed.
I have been given favored quarters within the villa.
To serve as our master's right hand.
The one he wipes his ass with.
Ah, a witty turn of phrase.
One of many splendors i shall miss Of being a gladiator.
You were never a gladiator.
No.
Not after your blade found itself in my leg.
My gift to you.
One that has given great reward.
Everything i am, Everything i now possess, i owe to you.
No, that goes to the balcony.
Quickly, the Legatus arrives.
The new girl is slow to the task.
An act of charity.
We shall yet find proper use for her.
A great day, Dominus.
One that shall be remembered.
Where is the Legatus? Apologies.
My husband is delayed.
But you made promise.
Which will be well kept.
He yet intends proper visit, But requests good Batiatus give greeting Upon entering the city.
A great honor! When does he arrive? Now.
We must hurry! come.
Let us retire to the balcony to feast.
And review your sense of timing.
I would love nothing more, But i must return to the villa to gather my belongings.
To what end? I'm moving back to Rome! But your stay in Capua has been so brief.
Painfully.
Yet now that my husband campaigns for Praetor, He insists i remain at his side.
Are you well? The blood drains from your cheeks.
My heart but flutters at the The thought of losing you.
Memories of our time together will fade only with difficulty.
Your friendship, Lucretia, Has forever altered my life.
Spartacus.
I would make request.
Ask another, if you seek it granted.
It is not for me, but for my brother.
Batiatus orders us parted.
Duro greets the news with laugh and fucking smile.
Yet i fear he shall not survive the arena on his own.
You are not alone in the thought.
Batiatus shows you much favor.
A word from your lips could see the decision undone.
Batiatus favors no one but himself.
Yeah! The Legatus! Legatus Glaber! Your arrival honors the fair city of Capua! An honor i expected matched by greeting at the gate.
Well apologies.
I had thought that.
.
Let us move past it.
My ears burn with reports of lawlessness since last i visited.
The magistrate's murder was unfortunate As was that of Ovidius and his family.
and now the cousin of senator Crassus goes missing.
Let us retire to my villa, and we can discuss these and other matters at length.
I prefer to speak with someone in authority.
Good Mercato awaits.
I shall accompany you? That won't be necessary.
Await me at your villa.
When shall i expect you? When i arrive.
Crixus! You are summoned.
I long for the night, to continue What was last interrupted.
I cannot meet you.
Tis but one night.
There's no cause for this.
Yes, cause.
Enough to drown us both in tears.
Dominus has given me to another.
Who? Tell me his name! What does it matter? We have lived in a dream.
And now we must awaken.
Do not be troubled, mighty Crixus.
Capua cheers your name once more.
Soon you will seize the mantle of champion from that fucking Thracian.
And everything shall be as it was before you fell to Theokoles.
I long for it to be so.
As do I.
Something's wrong Apologies, Domina.
Naevia! The shit fuck beckons me to the city, Only to spurn me like a thin wasted whore! Once again the gods spread the cheeks to ram cock in fucking ass! Perhaps a gentle nudge, to remind the Legatus Of your importance? Hmm, make the arrangements.
Glaber will bend to my fucking will.
Or break in the denying of it.
Lucretia! You need to have fucking words with Ilithyia What's happened? I am with child.
You're to be A father, Quintus.
Well, wine! Wine for the fucking house, eh! We must celebrate! We must celebrate.
This fucking village.
Finally.
I had feared you absorbed for the night.
The curse of Mercato's incompetence.
Cousin of Crassus vanishes, and no theory rattles around in his empty head.
Theories pale against the obvious.
Licinia's tongue was suspected of lounging in less esteemed places than around her husband's cock Whereas mine has made do with naught but idle conversation.
I fear it may not have been as idle as you would have me believe.
What promises have you made Batiatus and his faded bitch? The flesh monger looks to me with rheumy eyes, brimming with expectation.
I promise nothing, save word on their behalf to my dearly missed husband Batiatus is little better Than the beasts that bear his mark.
True, but they do provide a certain amusement.
Humor their intent.
No more can be asked from a man of your station.
My promise discharged, and we shall return to rome.
And more civilized company.
Fetch another.
And hold onto it this time.
Aurelia.
I beg a moment.
Alone.
You cannot be under the care of Batiatus.
The deed is done.
Then i shall see it undone.
My winnings in the arena Are not fucking wanted.
Varro asked that i see you taken care of.
Then return him to me.
Varro's son.
He is safe? He stays with my brother.
To be raised free of his father's debt.
Absent his mother.
What of the child in carry? It was not fathered by Varro.
Without him I I had it removed from my concerns.
As i would be from yours.
Batiatus is not to be trusted.
Do not lay faith in him.
My husband is dead.
And with him all faith.
As your eyes witness, no coin has been spared in restoring the villa! All will marvel upon privileged entry, And be humbled by the storied history Of the house of Batiatus! It is a vast improvement.
Hm, the gods have truly blessed them.
And continue to do so.
If fortune so favors, why do you continue to press so brazenly for my support? True fortune extends no further than a man's ambitions.
Mine stretch well beyond the sands of the arena.
How far beyond? To the very doors of political office.
In a minor capacity.
At first.
Well, let us entertain it for a moment.
What men of status lend you their confidence? Magistrate Calavius had voiced his endorsement.
Before the coward Solonius forever stilled his tongue.
Base villain.
The way he would stare with his teeth.
Ny heart is moved by the tragedy.
Yet my head remains fixed.
What advantage would i gain by association With a Lanista? My gladiators ignite the passion of the crowd.
Lend name to my cause, and see their deafening cheers transformed into demands for claudius Glaber, And his desired position of Praetor.
They do favor Batiatus men like no others.
Especially Spartacus.
The Thracian.
And what does it say that your finest gladiator Was my worst soldier? That i am the greatest Lanista in the republic.
For i have taken a wild beast, and forged him into a god.
It's a bold claim.
Built on a foundation of fucking granite.
I would see your words made flesh.
Easily conjured.
Spartacus trains in the square with the other men.
I have descended into the bowels Of your ludus once before, and did not care for the stench.
Summon the Thracian to the villa, Along with the rest of your men.
All of them? All of them.
The champion of Capua.
A sad day when an honored city elevates a cur To such position.
I see you've taught the animal not to speak out of turn.
And i would have demonstration of other tricks The Thracian has learned.
Unchain him.
Which of my men would you have oppose him? None.
Formation.
Spartacus wields practice swords.
I fear he's at a disadvantage.
I but give him chance to prove his legend.
Iovis.
How exciting.
Begin! Vesper! Linus! Legatus You opened this door, Lanista.
And we shall pass through it.
Behold.
The legend is proved.
Dominus.
This savage caused rome great offense! Yet it would appear that you have broken the man.
The way he bows his head in deference.
Would i be afforded such courtesies, i wonder, if patronage were awarded? He would be yours to command, as would all my men.
Kneel.
And it shall be so.
Legatus.
Crixus! You fucking cunt! Calm yourself! Slaves running wild! This is what you would have me give name towards? What seizes your fucking wits? speak! I yet but touch my gift, and Crixus goes mad.
I felt her maidenhood long absent when we lay together.
Now i know whose cock was in her first.
You whore! How long? How fucking long? How long have you hidden laughter behind a polite smile! How long have you been luring him to your filthy slave cunt? What is it? what is it? Give it to me.
Give it to me! How did you come by it? I took it.
To open the gate.
So you could lie with Crixus.
You alone knew of my feelings for him.
And yet you betray me.
Crixus never loved you.
He did only as commanded.
Mira! Domina.
Bring me a knife.
You have assurance Crixus will be punished.
I fear your hands too soft for the task.
You are mistaken.
they are as steel, hardened to their purpose.
As i to mine.
We return to Rome, absent unworthy entanglements.
Do not turn from me! You forget your place, Lanista! No.
i secure it.
Clear the fucking room! Tell Ashur to bring our gift for the Legatus! Forget your gifts.
I would part as from a troubling dream, Untethered by the memory of it.
Oh you will remember this day.
Until you lay to slumber, never to awaken.
I fear we have let events run the best of us.
Perhaps a cup of wine to er, cool the head.
We are long past civilized recourse.
Your husband presses issue.
i would see it closed.
As would I.
Can i believe this will make a difference? Open it and see.
What is this abomination? But a piece of the whole.
Licinia.
Cousin of Crassus.
You murdered Licinia? No.
Your wife did.
He lies.
A most heinous act.
One i was content to help obscure, Under promise of her aid in obtaining your favor.
Now i fear Licinia's body may resurface.
On the grounds of your villa, perhaps? I will see the tongue ripped from your fucking mouth! Even so ruined, it would yet speak the truth.
cladius.
You cannot believe me capable of such a thing.
Patronage is granted.
A portion of my men will remain stationed against further embarrassments.
Make all other arrangements with Ilithyia.
She will be remaining here in Capua.
No! No man is above retribution for offenses committed against the house of Batiatus.
No gladiator.
No champion.
Even the men that guard you, should they be guilty of deceit or incompetence.
Hector found his key removed.
His head follows.
The fault lies in my own breast, With heart grown too large.
This cannot stand.
Legatus claudius Glaber is now our honored patron.
And he has opened my eyes to the error of my generosity.
One that demands correction.
Embrace the pain.
It is the only way.
I expect your meetings with Crixus to end.
Quintus Do not fucking speak.
That you would think me a fool is insult enough.
I have always known.
And turned eye away only because it made you happy, and caused me no thought.
Those days have ended.
Set your attentions towards our child.
And do not see them stray.
Enough! Crixus! Crixus! Grant them a moment.
He was our champion once.
Allow him such respect.
I have destroyed us.
We yet live.
Where do they take you? I do not know.
I will win my freedom.
I will not rest until i find you.
It is time.
He speaks of freedom, as did Barca.
I give you my word, that I shall aid him in the seeking of it.
No.
You must not let him broach the subject.
Barca was not freed.
Batiatus took his life.
Fuck ass, you roman cock.
Shut your fucking mouth.
I would caution softer words.
The shit keeps rising higher in this fucking hole.
Perhaps it best not to be present, When it fills the mouth.
What do you speak of? I speak of nothing.
Nothing sounds much like escape.
And how would "nothing" find way past Batiatus and all his fucking romans? There is but one path.
We kill them all.
